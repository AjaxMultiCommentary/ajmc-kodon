## About the AjMC platform

The AjMC platform enables the non-linear, comparative reading of 17 commentaries on _Ajax_ (for the detailed corpus composition see the [Bibliography page](https://ajmc.unil.ch/bibliography)). Commentaries in the public domain are openly accessible, while those under copyright are accessible exclusively to logged in users.

**NB**: The current release of the platform is work-in-progress; new features will be added in future releases and the underlying data is continuosly being improved.

## About the project

This project explores the notion of a digital commentary by focusing on one commentary’s tradition: that of Sophocles’ _Ajax_. In this project we focus on the historical and epistemological dimension of such publications, and study the history of this genre and of its exegetic practices. In order to enable the study of all published commentaries on the Ajax, digitized commentaries are being processed through an ad-hoc pipeline and transformed into a multi-commentary.

The project (Sept. 2020 - Aug. 2024) has been generously funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation under an Ambizione grant (no. PZ00P1_186033).
